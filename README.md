The original color scheme can still be found in `color.el`

````emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/lisp/color.el")
```

I have updated it recently and converted it to a bonafide theme.  That
theme can be found in `wfv-color-theme.el`. Put it in your `.emacs.d`,
select it in `M-x customize-themes` and enjoy.
